/**
 * THE PREVIEW PAPER. While a pinch preview lives (and through the bounce its settle may start), the lined, grid or
 * dotted paper is not the scroller's own background moved through its gradient stops: it is an element under the
 * scroller carrying a copy of that background, moved by a composited transform, and the scroller's background is off.
 * These cells read that element against the text, against the scroller's own paper it stands in for, and against
 * every path that takes it down, at DSF 2 in headless Chromium. Every cell's red comes first: a behaviour of the element
 * reads red on the tree before it, and every parity reading has a plant, built into the page by an exact source
 * substitution, that must turn it red.
 *
 * Tolerances: the paper against the text, 2 device px at rest (as the pan cells), 2.5 on the element, whose rules land
 * on whole device px and so may sit up to half a device px from the text.
 *
 * WHERE THE RULES LAND: the element's offset is rounded so that the copy's rules land on whole device px of the zoom in
 * force (offset x kd = round(u + f) - f, f the fraction the copy's phase sits off this zoom's grid), which is where the
 * settle's snap puts them: the lift moves the paper by nothing. Rounding the offset alone (the SNAP_TRANSLATE_ONLY plant)
 * leaves the rules f off the grid on zoom frames and the lift jump up to a device px; under it the existing SNAP_TWICE
 * plant would read .47 against the .5 lift bar, blind. The LIFT JUMP arms at 130 percent, where f is not 0, close that gap.
 *
 * RIGHT-TO-LEFT notes get no element: they keep the scroller's own route, and with it the current route's drag cost.
 *
 * Plants (HW_PAPER_PREVIEW_PLANT_*=1, one at a time; a plant whose anchor is not in the source throws):
 *   BYPASS_SETTLE / BYPASS_CANCEL / BYPASS_COMMIT / BYPASS_UNMOUNT / BYPASS_NOTE_SWITCH  the one place the element comes
 *     down ignores that path (the CHOKE POINT arm of that path goes red, the others stay green);
 *   SWAP_ON_NAN      a pitch that is not a length still puts the element up (HOST PITCH, not a length);
 *   PARSEFLOAT_PITCH a pitch in another unit is read as px (HOST PITCH, rem);
 *   FOLD_WRITTEN_PITCH the element folds by the overlay's planned pitch, not the host's (HOST PITCH, px);
 *   NONE_SWAPS       a note with no paper still gets an element (OVERRIDES, note none);
 *   NO_TILE_COPY     the copy leaves out the tile size and position (OVERRIDES, dots);
 *   SWAP_ON_RTL      a right-to-left scroller gets an element (RTL);
 *   BOX_ONCE         the element's box is not re-read on preview frames (BOX, a host inset removed mid-preview);
 *   COPY_BEFORE_PAN_OFF the copy is taken with a standing pan still in its stops (SWAP PARITY, standing pan);
 *   LATE_IN / LATE_OUT / CLASS_LATE_OUT the element goes up, or comes down, or the scroller's paper comes back, a frame
 *     late (SWAP PARITY: a frame with no paper, or with two);
 *   NO_SNAP / SNAP_BEFORE_FOLD  the element's offset is not put on the device px grid, or is folded after it is (SMEAR);
 *   SNAP_TRANSLATE_ONLY the rounding ignores the copy's phase fraction (LIFT JUMP at 130 percent);
 *   SCROLL_AREA / NO_MARGIN the element is as large as the scroll area, or has no margin (BOUNDS);
 *   LEAK             a taken-down element stays in the page (LEAK);
 *   TWO_ELEMENT_LAYERS the element carries a second, transparent background layer (SMEAR grid at 10 percent: 0 lost);
 *   NO_COLOR_COPY    the copy leaves out the scroller's background colour (SWAP PARITY under a theme colour, during);
 *   SKIP_RESTORE     the element comes down but the scroller's own background stays suppressed (SWAP PARITY under a theme
 *                    colour, after);
 *   RESIDUAL_WRONG_SIGN the snap's residual is carried the wrong way through the preview, so the lift moves the paper by
 *                    twice it (LIFT JUMP, the off-grid arm);
 *   STALE_AT_SWAP_OUT the swap-out reuses what the swap-in left the scroller instead of the pan in force.
 *                    BLIND on these fixtures, measured: their settle spends the whole pan into the scroll, so
 *                    "what the swap-in left" and "the pan in force" are both nothing and no reading moves. Kept, because a
 *                    settle that cannot spend its pan (a page with no scroll range) is exactly where it would bite;
 *   SKIP_PITCH_GATE  a background of gradients on a period of its own is taken for the paper (A THEME'S OWN GRADIENTS).
 *
 * WHY SNAP_TWICE IS INERT HERE, and must not be re-added to these arms without reading this. On the scroller's own route
 * that plant applies the at-rest snap's residual a second time and the lift jump doubles. On this route the element's
 * offset is rounded so the rules land on the whole device px nearest the text (K5), and that rounding absorbs the doubled
 * residual: the plant changes no reading. Measured, not assumed (plant run p33: green, with its cell's premises holding).
 * It is retired for this route - it stays on the current-route cells, where it still reddens - in favour of plants that
 * target where THIS mechanism would fail instead: STALE_AT_SWAP_OUT and RESIDUAL_WRONG_SIGN above.
