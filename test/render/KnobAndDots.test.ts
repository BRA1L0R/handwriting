/**
 * Two things alan sees on ORION and nobody sees on the dev machine: the
 * eraser pop's slider knob sitting off the track's centre line, and the
 * strip's grip showing no dots at all.
 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH A REAL BROWSER, AND WHY IT IS WORTH PIXELS. Every other
 * file in this directory measures BOXES - `getBoundingClientRect` and
 * `getComputedStyle`. Neither can see either of these defects:
 *
 *   - the track and the thumb are `::-webkit-slider-runnable-track` and
 *     `::-webkit-slider-thumb`. A pseudo-element has no element, so it has no
 *     rect to ask for. The only place their geometry exists is the pixels.
 *   - a dot that is painted in a colour too close to what is behind it is
 *     painted exactly as instructed. There is no box wrong, no declaration
 *     dropped, nothing for a computed-style read to catch.
 *
 * So this file screenshots the real elements, hands the PNG back into the
 * page, and reads the composited pixels out of a canvas. What it measures is
 * what the compositor produced, at a stated device pixel ratio.
 *
 * AND WHY THE RATIO IS THE POINT. `margin-top: -7px` is exactly `(4 - 18) / 2`
 * and therefore exactly right whenever the boxes land on whole device pixels,
 * which is every measurement this suite has ever taken - all of them at ratio
 * 1. Orion is fractional. A test at ratio 1 proves nothing about it, so every
 * measurement below is taken at 1.389 - alan's - AND at 1, so that a fix for
 * one is not a trade against the other.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:render.

	/**
	 * THE ASSERTION THAT WAS WATCHED RED, and what it turned out to measure.
	 *
	 * The one above was not enough on its own. Reverted to `margin-top: -7px`
	 * over a 4px track and run at 1.389, it stayed GREEN: the knob came out
	 * 0.092 device pixels off the line, against 0.028 for the construction
	 * that replaced it. Headless chromium is not alan's screen.
	 *
	 * So this test compared where the thumb sat in the CONTROL at the two
	 * ratios, and the figure it had was the thumb's centre from the top edge
	 * of the screenshot. Measured at every nudge (2026-09-07), that edge is
	 * not the control's: the screenshotter rounds the clip to a whole device
	 * pixel and the page paints the control where layout put it, and from
	 * nudge 0.5 on the two are a row apart - at BOTH ratios, with nothing in
	 * the stylesheet changed. Thumb centre from the clip's top edge:
	 *
	 *                     nudge 0 - 0.4     nudge 0.5 - 0.9
	 *   ratio 1           11.014 css        12.006 css
	 *   ratio 1.389       10.944 css        11.945 css
	 *
	 * Each ratio's reading was taken at whichever nudge centred worst, so the
	 * "drift" between them was 0.070 or 0.93 depending on which side of 0.5
	 * each ratio's worst nudge fell - a number that any layout change above
	 * the slider could flip (a 10px taller chip row read 0.791) and that the
	 * old `margin-top: -7px` table, 11.014 against 11.945, is the same two
	 * readings of. Measured from the control's OWN painted top edge instead,
	 * the thumb sits at 10.94 - 11.03 css at every nudge and both ratios, and
	 * the old construction reads the same. The guard was reading the
	 * screenshotter.
	 *
	 * What a reader can see is the thumb against the track, at their ratio,
	 * which the assertions above measure to a device pixel; and the thumb
	 * against the row it sits in, which must not wander as the pop lands on
	 * different fractions of a pixel. So this test now reads the control's box
	 * out of the pixels - see `readControlBox` - and asserts the thumb's
	 * place in it is ONE number across every nudge at both ratios: the spread
	 * of all twenty readings, not a pair of worst cases. The limit is kept: a
	 * quarter of a CSS pixel, against a measured spread of 0.09.
	 *
	 * What it does NOT do is reproduce the defect on orion. In this engine no
	 * construction tried - equal boxes, the 4px track with `-7px`, `-7px`
	 * alone, a half-pixel offset - moves the thumb with the ratio at all;
	 * that is the engine laying out in CSS pixels and scaling the paint. The
	 * construction that makes the centring hold in every engine is the two
	 * equal boxes with no offset, and the test after this one holds the
	 * stylesheet to it, because no pixel here can.

/**
 * THE HOST'S OWN RANGE RULES, which nothing above loads.

 * of its declarations are `position: relative; top: var(--slider-thumb-y)`:
 * an upward shift sized for ITS 6px track and ITS thumb, -6px on desktop and
 * -9px on mobile. Our thumb rule is more specific, so it wins every property
 * it declares - and leaves every one it does not to the host. Every measurement above
 * injects styles.css alone, so a host declaration we fail to override is
 * invisible to it, which is how a knob a radius above its line reached two
 * machines in two themes (alan and a second user, 2026-09-06) with this file
 * green.
 *
 * The fixture is the host's range rules REDUCED to what moves a thumb (see the
 * file's own comment for where they came from). The shift's value is a
 * parameter of the measurement, and both values the app ships are run. The
 * assertions above are left exactly as they are: they stay the negative
 * control, the knob without the host's stylesheet, and this block is the same
 * measurement with it.
