/**
 * READABLE LINE LENGTH, ZOOM IN, at an EXTERNAL SCALE other than 1.
 *
 * `PaperPinchPan.test.ts`'s ZOOM IN arm covers the x contract (grid's vertical
 * rules and the dots stay on the text column's left edge through a re-centring
 * pinch and its settle) only at external scale 1 - the host's own CSS scale
 * pinned to 1, as it is when Obsidian's window zoom sits at 100 percent. The
 * paper's column drift (`InkOverlay.ts` `anchorPanTo`, `paperColumnDrift`)
 * shares its x frame with the committed ink's own preview offset
 * (`applyPreviewInkOffset`), and the ink's own comment there records a units
 * bug measured at external scale 0.8: a genuine column move on zoom-in applied
 * at 0.8 of its size, 34 device px off. This cell is the paper's counterpart:
 * the same staged zoom-in, grid paper, Readable line length on, with the host
 * pre-scaled 0.8 the way `ScrollColumnAnchorPinch.test.ts`'s `options.external`
 * pre-scales its own pane (`host.style.transform = scale(external)`, applied
 * once before the gesture, never touched again).
 *
 * READING IN DEVICE PX. A rect read after the host's own transform already
 * carries the external factor - `getBoundingClientRect` and the screenshot
 * agree with what a real compositor paints. What does NOT carry it is
 * `viewportFixture.snap("paper").state.zoom`, which is `pinchScaleNow` alone
 * (`getNoteViewportState`): the pinch scale, never multiplied by the host's
 * own external scale. So every place `PaperPinchPan.test.ts`'s reader divides
 * a device-px reading by `zoom * DSF` to fold it into one lattice pitch, this
 * file's copy divides by `zoom * EXTERNAL * DSF` instead - the actual painted
 * scale. Get that wrong here and the tolerance band drifts by a whole pitch
 * fraction before the product code is even in question, which is exactly the
 * confusion the units plant below is built to catch on the PRODUCT side.
 *
 * MEASURED (the x contract):
 *   - RED on the build before this fix, at external 0.8 and 1, on staged and
 *     settled readings alike: the paper had no x anchor there at all, so the
 *     vertical rules drift off the text column as soon as the pinch
 *     re-centres it.
 *   - GREEN on the fix unplanted, at external 0.8 and 1.
 *   - Under HW_PAPER_PAN_PLANT_NO_DRIFT: RED at external 0.8 and 1 on stages
 *     1-3 (the drift term is gone outright, the cheap sanity plant).
 *   - Under HW_PAPER_PAN_PLANT_EXTERNAL_UNITS_DOUBLE: RED at external 0.8 on
 *     stages 1-3, 15 to 28 device px off, GREEN at external 1 - the
 *     differential is the point of this arm.
 *
 * UNITS PLANT (the point of this arm): `paperColumnDrift` is computed from
 * `columnLocal` values that are themselves host-local px (carrying the host's
 * external scale already, same as the ink's `columnLocalAt`), multiplied by
 * `next` - the pinch scale alone, no external factor anywhere in that line.
 * The plant applies the external factor to that product a second time, which
 * is a no-op at external 1 (multiplying by 1 changes nothing) and a real
 * distortion at 0.8. Both external legs live in THIS file's `it.each`, sharing
 * the one `beforeAll` bundle, so one plant run carries to both without relying
 * on `PaperPinchPan.test.ts` (which has no `HW_PAPER_PAN_PLANT_EXTERNAL_UNITS_DOUBLE`
 * anchor of its own and would bundle unplanted - a silent non-run, not a
 * control) - that differential is what shows the arm is reading the UNITS and
 * not merely the presence of a drift term (the existing
 * `HW_PAPER_PAN_PLANT_NO_DRIFT` already proves the latter, reused below as the
 * cheaper sanity plant).
 *
 * ALIASING. `relOffDev` reads modulo the pitch, so a plant error that lands on
 * a whole number of pitches reads as zero - a false GREEN that proves nothing.
 * The units plant scales the drift term by the external factor a second time,
 * so its error against the correct drift is `|external - 1| x drift`, about
 * `0.2 x |moved|` at external 0.8 (`moved` approximates the drift the paper
 * must track) and exactly zero at external 1 - the plant is a no-op there BY
 * CONSTRUCTION, so that leg carries no aliasing premise at all. Logged every
 * run; asserted, where the plant actually perturbs anything, clear of the
 * aliasing band before the tolerance checks are trusted.
 *
 * Tolerance: 2 device px, same as the sibling file. Premise at the last
 * preview stage: the column re-centred by AT LEAST ONE PAINTED PITCH (not
 * merely "some" displacement) - `max(pitch in device px at that stage,
 * 10 x TOL_DEV)` - or the stage is VOID, not green, and the run is not a
 * proof either way.
 *
 * PASS ASSERTIONS ARE X ONLY. y is read and logged with every reading but not
 * asserted, because at external 0.8 this reader's y is not paper: the y
 * centres there include one band on the same device row of the patch (39.5)
 * in every reading, rest through settled, on both builds, while the zoom goes
 * from 100 to 150 percent - it moves with neither the zoom nor the pan - and
 * `abs.y`, a max over the first centres, reads that band alone on the fix
 * (15.7 device px at rest, 28.1 settled). This copied reader has no
 * pitch-lattice filter to drop it, and where the band comes from has not been
 * read. External 1 shows no such band. The bands on the pitch lattice do read
 * the y contract: on the fix they sit within 1.3 device px of the note's top
 * in every reading at both externals; on the build before this fix they sit
 * 7 to 41 device px off during the pinch, and on it at rest and once settled.
