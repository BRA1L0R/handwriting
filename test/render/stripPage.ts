/**
 * The page half of the rendered-geometry harness: the real `MobileTools`
 * strip, built by the real constructor, inside a real browser.
 *
 * This file is BUNDLED BY ESBUILD AT TEST TIME and injected into a Playwright
 * page. It is never part of the plugin build. Its whole reason to exist is
 * that the boxes measured here must be the ones the shipped constructor and
 * the shipped stylesheet produce, not a reconstruction of them - a
 * reconstruction of the thing under test measures the reconstruction.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL HERE
 *   - `MobileTools`, its `dropSlider`, and the three sliders' own
 *     min/max/step, read off the inputs the constructor built.
 *   - The pen and highlighter palettes, imported from `InkColor`.
 *   - The browser's layout.
 *   - `styles.css`, injected verbatim by the caller.
 *
 * WHAT IS STANDING IN
 *   - Obsidian's DOM helpers (`createDiv` and friends). Obsidian installs
 *     these on `HTMLElement.prototype` at runtime and they are not part of
 *     any DOM the browser ships, so a page without them cannot construct the
 *     strip at all. They build elements; none of them decides a width, and
 *     `setText` is the only one whose output the measurement reads.
 *   - `MobileToolsHost`, a no-op fake. The host is asked for state; nothing
 *     it returns reaches a stylesheet.

 *
 * WHAT IS STANDING IN: Obsidian's leaf markup, rebuilt here from the class
 * names the app actually uses - `.workspace-leaf-content > .view-header >
 * .view-actions`, with the header laid out the way Obsidian lays it out (a
 * fixed-height bar whose actions sit at its right end). This is a
 * PARAMETER of the measurement, not part of it: if Obsidian renames
 * `.view-actions` or stops putting it in the header, this page keeps passing
 * and the plugin stops working. That is the honest limit of what a harness
 * with no Obsidian in it can say, and it is the reason the class name is
 * written here exactly once, beside the note saying so.
 *
 * `header` false builds the NOTE's arrangement instead: the strip is mounted
 * inside the content area. Normally that content starts below the header;
 * `overlayHeader` models the mobile arrangement where host actions float over
 * it, which is the case where the note must find its row through the leaf.
