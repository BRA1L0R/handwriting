/**
 * A WINDOW RESIZE WITH GRID PAPER: the paper stays on the text column through
 * a resize, not only through a pinch. `PaperPinchPan.test.ts` (this fixture's
 * source) covers the paper against LINES/GRID/DOTS live pinch frames, AT
 * REST, ZOOM IN/OUT and SETTLE FRAMES, but every one of those reads a
 * gesture; none of them changes the editor pane's width and reads the paper
 * against the column afterward.
 *
 * THE RESIZE TARGET: `.cm-editor` is the
 * zoom host, and once the note viewport owns it (`edgeAudit.commit` below),
 * its OWN width is one of the properties `applyViewportBox` (InkOverlay.ts)
 * writes every time `handleResize` fires - so writing it from the test races
 * the plugin's own writes and skips the path a real window resize actually
 * takes: the CONTAINER resizes (`.cm-editor`'s `parentElement`, i.e. the
 * `[data-rig]` host `viewportFixture.setup` creates) -> that element's
 * ResizeObserver -> `handleResize` -> `applyViewportBox`, which then re-lays
 * `.cm-editor` out to match. This arm resizes the CONTAINER only. Both terms
 * of the column's margin follow a resize (the live "auto" term and the
 * "frozen" term `applyViewportBox` re-measures), so the natural column moves;
 * premises 1 and 2 below check that the plugin took the resize and that the
 * column moved before anything downstream of them is trusted.
 *
 * THE PAPER'S OWN FOLLOWING MECHANISM is separate from the column's margin:
 * `capturePaperOrigin` (InkOverlay.ts) re-measures the text origin's left
 * edge on every extent update (resize included, via `handleResize` ->
 * `updateExtent`) and re-plans the paper's phase-x only when that edge
 * really moved. A resize is a path into that same function that no existing
 * cell drives; this arm does.
 *
 * READING: the grid lattice against the text column's left edge, in device
 * px (`readPatch`'s `abs.x`, copied from PaperPinchPan.test.ts - see below).
 * The contract: that offset stays within 1 device px of its value before
 * the first resize, on every stage, whether or not that particular stage's
 * resize actually moved the column.
 *
 * Y IS LOGGED, NOT ASSERTED: at 520px the y reading finds one band more than
 * at rest (count.y 7 -> 8), loses its lattice (tight.y .80) and reads
 * 20.006017157234055 device px off its rest value - identically, to fifteen
 * significant figures, on the build before this fix and on the fix. A reading
 * that cannot tell the two apart is not a guard. This reader has no
 * pitch-lattice filter and logs no band centres, so which band that is has
 * not been read; the same signature in PaperPanExternalScaleZoomIn.test.ts is
 * a band that moves with neither the zoom nor the pan, not paper. y is still
 * read and logged every run.
 *
 * PREMISES (checked before anything is asserted; none of these is certain
 * going in - all logged, none trusted from a worked guess alone):
 * 1. THE PLUGIN TOOK THE RESIZE: after each stage, the scroller's clientWidth
 *    moved by the container's own width delta (within 2 css px) and
 *    `.cm-editor`'s inline width was rewritten (not left stale) - or the test
 *    resized a container the plugin never measured from.
 * 2. THE COLUMN ACTUALLY MOVED: the text column's left edge (against the
 *    scroller) moved by at least one painted pitch, vs rest, on some stage -
 *    otherwise a resize cell that never resized anything meaningful would
 *    pass by doing nothing.
 * 3. THE MOVE CLEARS THE READER'S OWN ALIASING FLOOR: `abs.x` is a circular
 *    mean modulo the pitch, so a move that lands close to a whole number of
 *    pitches would look like no change even on a broken build. For the
 *    stage that satisfies premise 2, `d = circ(move in layout px, PITCH) x
 *    DSF x zoom` must clear `2 x RESIZE_TOL_DEV + 1` device px, logged
 *    either way; a stage that cannot clear this is VOID for this arm's
 *    contract regardless of premise 2, and the fix is a different stage
 *    width, not a looser threshold.
 *
 * MEASURED: both stages (900, 520) clear premises 2 and 3. On the build
 * before this fix, which anchors the grid to the scroller's edge rather than
 * the text column, the offset reads 25 device px at rest and moves by the
 * column's move modulo the pitch - 20 at 900px, 8 at 520px - failing the
 * contract on both stages. On the fix both stages stay within 1 device px,
 * and under the plant below they fail by the same 20 and 8.
 *
 * PLANT: HW_PAPER_RESIZE_PLANT_NO_XREPLAN=1 makes `capturePaperOrigin`'s
 * commit of a detected leftward move conditional on a TEST-CONTROLLED flag
 * (`(globalThis as any).__hwFreezePaperX`), not on "is this the first call".
 * Freezing after the first call would catch the WRONG first:
 * `capturePaperOrigin` already fires once during ordinary mount, before
 * `edgeAudit.commit` below takes the viewport over, so `paperOriginLeft` is
 * already non-null by the time commit's own readable-line-length centring
 * jump needs to land - a freeze keyed on "already set" swallows that jump too
 * and reddens AT REST, before any resize. This plant freezes nothing until
 * the test says so: it sets
 * `window.__hwFreezePaperX = true` AFTER reading `rest` and BEFORE the first
 * resize (below), so every capture up to and including the commit-triggered
 * one still lands normally - AT REST reads ~0 under the plant exactly as
 * unplanted (asserted below, gated on the plant env var only: the build
 * before this fix has no x anchor at all, so its own rest reading is unrelated
 * to this plant and must not be asserted against it). Only resize-triggered captures, which
 * all happen after the flag is set, are skipped - the exact failure mode
 * this arm exists to catch. Unplanted, the planted line does not exist, so
 * setting the flag from the test does nothing either way.
