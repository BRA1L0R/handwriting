/**
 * A rendered-geometry harness: measure what the engine actually paints, from
 * the plugin's OWN stylesheet.
 *
 * Every CSS assertion in this repo before this file was a text match against
 * `styles.css`. A text match cannot see a declaration the engine ignores, and
 * it cannot see a size at all - which is most of what the strip's chrome is
 * judged on. Two real defects walked past a green text-matching suite: a
 * `min-width: 5ch` floor that sat below the element's own border-box width
 * and never bound, and `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` under a face with
 * no `tnum` feature, where the engine simply declines.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN ANSWER
 *   - the rendered box of a real element built by real plugin code, under the
 *     real `styles.css`: how big a pop is, where a folded row's buttons sit,
 *     whether a strip dodges the pane's header
 *   - what a declaration RESOLVED to (`getComputedStyle`), not what it said
 *   - what a LAYOUT-DEPENDENT code path does. `layoutOverflow` bails when the
 *     pane measures zero, which is every element in the unit suite, so the
 *     folded second row exists only here.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT ANSWER
 *   - anything about Obsidian. There is no Obsidian here. The theme
 *     variables below are INJECTED by this file, and an injected value is a
 *     parameter, not a measurement: a real theme sets different ones.
 *     The host's OWN RULES are not here either unless a test brings them:
 *     `hostCss` layers a hand-reduced fixture of them UNDER the plugin's
 *     sheet, in the order Obsidian loads a plugin's stylesheet, which is
 *     the only way this harness can see a host declaration the plugin
 *     forgot to override (the slider thumb's `top`, 2026-09-06, reached two
 *     users with every file here green).
 *   - anything about iOS or Android. Chromium is the default; the startup
 *     regression also runs in Playwright's desktop WebKit, but that is a
 *     patched build and its font stack is not iOS Safari's.
 *   - whether a pop is PLACED correctly. It measures the pop's own box;
 *     `hangUnder`'s re-centring and `popRightOffset`'s clamping are pinned
 *     separately, against rects rather than a render.
 *   - anything about a real device's pixel ratio, zoom, or accessibility text
 *     scaling.
 *   - correctness of anything the fake host stands in for.
