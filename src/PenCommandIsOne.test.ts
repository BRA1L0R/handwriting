/**
 * ONE PEN COMMAND (1.4.12). Alan, 2026-09-05: "there are two of these
 * Handwriting: Pen and Handwriting: toggle pen input on/off - i think that's
 * stupid there should only be one", then "Pen on / off like Mouse on / off".
 *
 * Two halves, both pinned here.
 *
 * THE REMOVAL is a source-and-table guard. `pen-ink-toggle` is gone from the
 * palette - no `addCommand` block, no entry in either `CommandPaletteSplit`
 * table - while its MECHANISM is untouched: `setPenInk` still exists, the
 * strip still has its keyboard button, and that button still reaches the
 * switch by the same id, because `DEFAULT_FOLD_ORDER` and every fold order
 * already saved to a user's data.json are written in it. So the id survives in
 * exactly one place and the guard below says which one; a second spelling
 * anywhere in `src` is the failure mode this catches - the dangling exec that
 * would leave the keyboard button pressing nothing.
 *
 * THE SEMANTICS are behavioural, against the real `PenInk` and `MouseInk`
 * module state. `penOnOff` (PenCommand.ts) is the whole of the rule and needs
 * no Obsidian: what it cannot reach - the nib, the tip modes, the toolbars -
 * comes in through `PenCommandHost`, and the fake below is main.ts's own host
 * with the chrome counted instead of drawn. Its `pickPen` calls
 * `markToolPicked` because that is precisely what `setInlineTool` does
 * (MouseInk.ts names it as one of the two writers of the pick), and a source
 * probe further down pins that main.ts's real `pickPen` is still that call, so
 * this fake cannot quietly stop describing it.

/**
 * THE HOTKEY 1.4.11 LEAVES BEHIND, and why the answer is a sentence.
 *
 * 1.4.11 shipped `pen-ink-toggle` as `Pen: on / off` (main.ts at refs/tags/1.4.11).
 * 1.4.12 has one pen command and does not register that id, so Obsidian - which
 * dispatches every hotkey through the command registry - resolves the user's key
 * to nothing. It is worse than a no-op: with no command registered there is no
 * row in the Hotkeys tab either, so the binding is invisible as well as dead.
 *
 * NEITHER CODE FIX EXISTS in `obsidian.d.ts` (1.13.1, node_modules):
 *
 *  - NO HIDDEN COMMAND. `Command` (the interface `addCommand` takes) is
 *    id/name/icon/mobileOnly/repeatable/hotkeys plus the four callbacks; there
 *    is no flag that keeps an entry out of the palette. The one thing that
 *    does hide a command is `checkCallback` - "Returning false or undefined
 *    causes the command to be hidden from the command palette" - and that is
 *    the SAME gate execution runs through ("If checking is false, then this
 *    function should perform the action"), so a command hidden that way cannot
 *    be fired by a hotkey either. Registering it visibly is the thing Alan's
 *    ruling forbids.
 *  - NO MIGRATION. The only `Hotkey` on the plugin surface is `Command.hotkeys`,
 *    "Sets the default hotkey" - write-once, at registration, for a command
 *    that will exist. `App` exposes keymap, scope, workspace, vault,
 *    metadataCache, fileManager, lastEvent, renderContext and secretStorage;
 *    there is no hotkey manager, no `customKeys`, and nothing that reads or
 *    writes what the user bound. `Plugin` has `addCommand` and `removeCommand`
 *    and no third door. Nothing in `src` reads a hotkey today, so there is not
 *    even a house precedent to follow.
 *
 * So the fix is option (c): SAY SO, in the two places a user meets an upgrade -
 * the what's-new popup and the manual - and keep the mechanism reachable, which
 * the retired-action tests above already pin. Pinned here because a sentence
 * nobody asserts is a sentence a later docs pass silently drops, and then the
 * defect is back with no trace that it was ever answered.
 */
