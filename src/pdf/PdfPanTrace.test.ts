/**
 * The pdf pan trace: the pure summary line, and the structural claim that
 * none of it runs with diagnostics off.
 *
 * The second half is the one that matters more, and it is not behaviour this
 * repo can execute: `penRaw` needs a mounted pdf viewer, and the cost being
 * asserted is a cost that shows up as NOTHING happening. So it is pinned as
 * source shape, the house technique (CommandPaletteSplit.test.ts,
 * InkSurfaceRules.test.ts), with comments blanked through `codeOnly` first -
 * a guard a comment can satisfy is a guard a comment can defeat, and this
 * file's own prose in the controller talks about `performance.now()` and
 * `recordPdfPanMove` at length.
 *
 * What the structural half asserts, in the order the cost is incurred:
 *
 *   - the pan branch reads NO switch of its own. `diagOn` comes from the one
 *     `diagnosticsEnabled()` call `penRaw` already made for its eight trace
 *     branches, so the instrument added zero boolean reads, not one.
 *   - the only clock read outside the gate is the `diagOn ? ... : 0` ternary
 *     that starts the measurement, which reads a local and calls nothing.
 *   - the recording call's innermost enclosing block is `if (diagOn)`, and
 *     the coalesced probe - the one genuinely expensive argument, since
 *     `getCoalescedEvents()` allocates - is inside it too.
 *
 * What it cannot answer: whether the numbers are RIGHT on a Surface. Nothing
 * here can. That is what the instrument is for.
