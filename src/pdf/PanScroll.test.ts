/**
 * The pan drag's arithmetic, and the rule that keeps it out of the DOM.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, and the second is the one the slice exists for. The first is
 * ordinary: `panBatchDelta` and `panScrollNext` are pure, so they are called.
 * The second cannot be executed by this repo at all - `penRaw` needs a mounted
 * pdf viewer, and the cost being asserted is a cost that shows up as NOTHING
 * happening, a forced layout that no longer occurs - so it is pinned as source
 * shape, the house technique (PdfPanTrace.test.ts, InkSurfaceRules.test.ts),
 * with comments blanked through `codeOnly` first. A guard a comment can
 * satisfy is a guard a comment can defeat, and the controller's own prose in
 * this area quotes `scroller.scrollLeft -= smp.x - last.x` while explaining
 * why it is gone.
 *
 * WHAT THE SOURCE HALF ASSERTS:
 *
 *   - the move path writes each scroll axis exactly ONCE, and mentions it
 *     exactly once, so a write cannot come back with a read attached;
 *   - it makes no read of the offsets by any of the spellings that reach them
 *     - a compound assignment, a bare mention on the right of anything, or
 *     `toContent`, which takes both;
 *   - pen-down does take the read, once, because a drag that never read at
 *     all would be a drag that scrolls from zero.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT ANSWER: whether the pan FEELS better on Alan's Surface.
 * Nothing here can. What it can say is that the layout flush the reviewer
 * pointed at is not in the move path any more, and that it cannot come back
 * without this failing.
