/**
 * The two ways a user sets one note's Infinite Canvas: the three-dot menu
 * beside "Paper background", and the command.
 *
 * Both are registered in main.ts, so both are sliced out of main.ts's source
 * (each marker proven present and unique), compiled, and run against fakes -
 * `BarsToggleCommand.test.ts`'s harness, for its reason: the behaviour that
 * ships is the block main.ts registers, not a copy of it written here.
 *
 * What these cells are for: the menu is ONE line with a tick (Alan, 09:4xZ:
 * three lines is too many), the tick has to read the note's real mode rather
 * than whether it holds an override, a click has to write the opposite of what
 * the tick shows, and the notice must never announce a choice the note did not
 * take. The third value, "use the setting", is the command's.
