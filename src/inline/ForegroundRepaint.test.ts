/**
 * The foreground repaint, driven for real.
 *
 * The bug it answers is unreproducible here - it needs an iPad under memory
 * pressure, and nobody on this project has one - so what CAN be pinned is
 * the wiring: the three events are all listened for, a return that delivers
 * all three costs one repaint and not three, the hidden edge repaints
 * nothing, and teardown leaves nothing behind on the document or the window.
 *
 * Driven through the host seam rather than jsdom globals because that is
 * what the module is written against, and because the listener bookkeeping
 * is the thing under test: a fake that COUNTS its listeners can fail an
 * unregistered teardown, which a real EventTarget cannot.
