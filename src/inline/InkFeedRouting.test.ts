/**
 * The feed decision, exercised through the router's real registered handlers
 * instead of the arbiter alone. InkFeed.test.ts proves the arithmetic; this
 * file proves the wiring: a WebKit-shaped stream (down, moves carrying
 * coalesced lists, up, zero raws — the iPad report of 2026-08-25) comes out
 * of InlinePenRouter as expanded onPenRaw deliveries, and a Chromium-shaped
 * stream still inks from raw alone with the move handler back to counting.
 *
 * The DOM here is the thinnest thing the constructor will hold still for:
 * an element fake that records addEventListener registrations so tests can
 * invoke the capture handlers directly, and a window stub for the mirror and
 * the end backstop. No jsdom; the suite runs where every other test runs.

 * explicit switch is the only way in, which the addendum leaves untouched
 * for a device that has seen a pen - and that is what these three pin.

/**
 * THE PEN-LESS DEVICE, STRAIGHT FROM LAUNCH - restored, and this time with

 *
 * NO `markPenHardwareSeen()` HERE, on purpose: this is Alan's mouse-only
 * machine, which has never seen a pen and never will. The whole of the
 * `mouse-lit-truth` defect was that the router's grant read "a tool is lit"
 * off the pen-ink switch, whose default is TRUE, so this block's first test
 * failed - and the fix applied then was to mark a pen, which left the real
 * device untested. `toolIsLit` (MouseInk.ts) now ANDs in whether a tool has
 * been PICKED, so the launch answer is honest and this block can say what it
 * always should have.
 *
 * ONE HONEST LIMIT, stated rather than left for the next reader: the harness
 * router wires no `penOff` callback (routerHarness.ts), so `!this.penOff()`
 * reads true here whatever `penInkEnabled()` says. The keyboard-mode test
 * below therefore proves that pen-off UNPICKS - which is what makes the
 * mouse let go - and not that the router's own pen-ink gate fires; that gate
 * is a callback the real surfaces supply and MobileTools.test.ts's
 * `penInksHere: () => false` rigs cover on the strip's side.
