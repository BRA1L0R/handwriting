/**
 * THE PALM GATE IS WARMED BY A PEN, NOT BY A POINTER THAT IS MERELY ACCEPTED.
 *
 * THE SYMPTOM. Mouse ink armed, no pen anywhere near the machine: the mouse
 * moves, and the next finger to land is swallowed as if a palm had settled
 * beside a working pen - or is held back from scrolling the note. A desktop
 * with a touchscreen and mouse ink armed decides a pen is near because a
 * mouse moved.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM. `InlinePenRouter`'s hover branch (pointermove and
 * pointerrawupdate alike) is entered by every pointer it accepts, and with
 * mouse ink armed a MOUSE is accepted through `mouseActsAsPen`. That branch
 * called `gate.penHoverSeen(now)` for every accepted pointer, so a mouse
 * warmed the palm gate's "a pen is near" window - the state `blocksNewTouch`
 * reads at touch pointerdown before it swallows the contact. The same branch
 * already made this exact distinction one line up, for `penHoverAt` (the
 * reticle's "hand on glass" stamp, written only under `pointerType === "pen"`);
 * the gate call now sits under the same test.
 *
 * THE RIG. The real router on the shared element fake (`test/routerHarness.ts`)
 * with the recorder callbacks, so a touch pointerdown here runs the router's
 * own touch branch and its own palm gate. `palmsBlocked` is the counter that
 * swallow path increments and nothing else does, so it is the assertion. The
 * negative controls are the important half: the gate exists for a real defect
 * (a palm planted just before the pen lands), and a real pen hovering or
 * writing must still swallow the palm exactly as before.
