/**
 * THE STANDING GUARD IS RE-ARMED BY A PEN, NOT BY A POINTER THAT IS MERELY
 * ACCEPTED.
 *
 * THE SYMPTOM. Mouse ink armed, no pen anywhere near the machine. A finger
 * pans the note and lifts, and the standing guard opens its native touch
 * window: touch-action restored on the scroller, the one-shot re-arm timer
 * running, so the next finger gesture is fully native, inertia included.
 * Then the mouse moves - the ordinary desk state - and the window slams
 * shut: touch-action: none is back, the re-arm timer is cancelled, and the
 * next finger is carried by the assist pan instead. With the mouse moving
 * DURING the pan, the lift finds the guard already reset and the window
 * never opens at all.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM. `InlinePenRouter`'s hover branch (pointermove and
 * pointerrawupdate alike) is entered by every pointer it accepts, and with
 * mouse ink armed a MOUSE is accepted through `mouseActsAsPen`. That branch
 * fed `manip.penSignal()` to the standing guard for every accepted pointer.
 * The guard's touch-action: none exists so a cold PEN contact meets a
 * committed opt-out and inks instead of panning; a mouse is not subject to
 * touch-action at all, so its hover buys the mouse nothing and costs the
 * finger its window. The signal now sits under the same
 * `pointerType === "pen"` test the `penHoverAt` stamp and the palm-gate warm
 * beside it already use.
 *
 * THE RIG. The real router on the shared element fake
 * (`test/routerHarness.ts`). The guard's style half writes the scroller's
 * inline touch-action and the subtree class, and those are the assertions:
 * "" with no class means the window is open, "none" with the class means
 * armed. A finger pan here is a touch down, one move past the assist slop
 * (so the assist engages and the lift reports "panned"), and a lift.
 *
 * The negative controls are the important half: a real PEN hovering after
 * the window opens must still re-arm the guard instantly, and a palm landing
 * beside that pen must still be swallowed. An armed mouse STROKE is left
 * exactly as it was: a claimed stroke owns the surface whatever pointer
 * holds it, and the last block pins that.
