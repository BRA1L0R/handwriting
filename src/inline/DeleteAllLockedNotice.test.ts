/**
 * `Delete all ink` on a note the store may not write NOW REFUSES.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE WAS, because the history is the reason the cases are shaped
 * the way they are. It was written as a CHARACTERISATION of a defect: the
 * command consulted exactly one lock, `damagedLocked`, and only to decide
 * whether to attempt the trash copy. Under any of the other three -
 * `legacyLocked`, `futureLocked`, `duplicateLocked` - `applyRemove` called
 * `take` unconditionally, so the strokes left memory and the note went blank;
 * the write it scheduled was dropped, because `snapshot` returns null for all
 * four locks; and `clearAllInk` returned the count it had taken BEFORE any of
 * that, so the command announced a successful wipe. The file on disk still
 * held every stroke, so nothing was lost - it was a false REPORT rather than a
 * data-loss defect - but the user was told the ink was gone and it came back
 * on the next load.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOW. That behaviour is ruled out. `deleteAllReadiness` is the
 * command's gate and it answers a typed reason; future, duplicate and legacy
 * are blocked, an unsettled record is refused, `unknown` is refused, and a
 * refusal produces NO preservation, no trash write, no session change, no live
 * bytes, no history entry and no success notice. The cases below were
 * converted in place rather than deleted, so each one still carries the
 * evidence it was written with and now asserts the ruled outcome instead of
 * the defect.
 *
 * DAMAGED REMAINS THE ONE EXPLICIT EXCEPTION, session-only by design: the file
 * on disk is already the artifact being protected and the wipe writes nothing
 * there. It is kept here as the control that the refusal is a decision about
 * writability and not a blanket "never delete".
 *
 * SILENCE IS NOT THE RULED END STATE. Every refusal routes through the
 * command's reporter, and every reason currently maps to null because Alan has
 * approved no wording for them. Assertions here therefore pin that nothing is
 * SAID rather than claiming that saying nothing is correct - when copy is
 * approved, those assertions are the ones that must change.
 *
 * The strings asserted here are the SHIPPED ones. Copy is Alan's; this file
 * names what is said today and proposes nothing.
