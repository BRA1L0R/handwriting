/**
 * A pen contact guards the page it is writing on, and nothing else.
 *
 * Alan, 2026-09-05: "i cant poke another note to switch while my pen eraser
 * end is touching the screen". The ownership guard was on the window with no
 * target test at all, so a finger poke anywhere in the app was eaten as the
 * claimed pen's mouse-compat fallout until the pen lifted.
 *
 * Three things are pinned here, and the third is the one that matters. The
 * predicate's own table, the containment test's awkward inputs, and - by
 * source, because no unit test can see a listener's ORDER - that the guard
 * asks the predicate BEFORE it calls preventDefault. A containment test that
 * runs after the swallow is not a fix, and the router's own tests would pass
 * either way.
