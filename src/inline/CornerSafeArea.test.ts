/**
 * The floating toolbar parks in a screen corner, and a phone's screen corners
 * are not all reachable: the top edge of a notched iphone is behind the
 * dynamic island and the bottom edge is the home indicator's swipe strip. A
 * control parked there is not merely ugly, it is untappable - the same class
 * of defect as the android notification shade (boox go 6, 2026-08-30), and
 * confirmed on hardware for ios (alan, iphone, 2026-09-02: "it's behind the
 * notch").
 *
 * The fix is an unconditional env() on every corner offset, and it is easy to
 * lose by accident, because three separate blocks re-declare `top`/`bottom`
 * for these elements and the last one to match wins. So this asserts the
 * stylesheet text directly - the pattern GuardStyle.test.ts already uses for
 * rules the code depends on but cannot observe in a unit test.
 *
 * What this canNOT prove: that ios actually reports a non-zero inset in
 * Obsidian's webview. That needs the device. It proves the stylesheet asks
 * for the inset everywhere it must, and that android's shade constant did
 * not get dragged along with it.

/*
 * THE POP'S WIDTH IS DECLARED, and that is load-bearing.
 *
 * `hangUnder` re-centres the pop from its own measured `offsetWidth` on every
 * refresh, so whatever decides that width decides whether the pop sits still
 * under a dragging finger. It used to be decided by the pop's CONTENTS - the
 * pop had no width of its own, so it took its widest child's - and the two
 * things that made a child change width both moved the pop:
 *
 *   - the live value readout, which gained and lost a character as the number
 *     under the slider crossed a whole pixel ("like the slider is just
 *     vibrating", alan, hardware, 2026-09-02);
 *   - the preset row, which is 28px wider with four pens saved than with
 *     none, so starring a pen jumped the pop sideways.
 *
 * The readout was patched by padding its label to a constant character count
 * and pinning a monospace family so a serif theme could not undo the padding.
 * That fixed the readout and nothing else, and this block used to assert it.
 * 1.4.12 removed the readout and gave the pop a width instead, which covers
 * every child at once, so what is worth pinning here is the width.
 *
 * Read through `bare` and `declarationsFor` rather than off the raw text, the
 * same as the corner rules above and for the same two reasons: commenting the
 * declaration out leaves the text in `css`, and a later rule beats an earlier
 * one, so the FIRST match is the wrong one to read.
