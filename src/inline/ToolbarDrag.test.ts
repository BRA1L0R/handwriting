/**
 * The two rules behind drag-to-anchor, attacked as arithmetic.
 *
 * Neither of them can be tested through the strip: the suite has no layout,
 * so a `MobileTools` built here measures zeros and every anchor is equidistant
 * from every drop. Split out for exactly that reason, the same split
 * `StripClearance.ts` and `StripOverflow.ts` already are, and what is left in
 * the class - the measuring, the painting, the pointer bookkeeping - is
 * covered by the drag tests at the foot of `MobileTools.test.ts`.
