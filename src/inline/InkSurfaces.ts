/**
 * The ink surfaces, named once.
 *
 * There are SIX places where a pointer becomes a stroke, and this project's
 * most expensive recurring defect - seven times in the 1.4.x cycle - is a
 * ruling that reached one of them and not another. The seventh is the shape of
 * all of them: the router already knew the `pointerType`, already passed it to
 * both surfaces, and each surface then decided independently what to do with
 * it. One decided right and one decided wrong, and the wrong one was invisible
 * for three releases because a comment asserted it was fine.
 *
 * This header said FOUR until 2026-09-03, and that was wrong the whole time.
 * `src/site/DemoInk.ts` ships on the website rather than in the plugin, so it
 * sits outside every plugin test and most greps, but it runs the plugin's real
 * ink path and it built strokes all along. It is the fifth. "Four" was not a
 * miscount so much as a scope the sentence never said out loud, which is how
 * every one of the seven divergences started.
 *
 * This header then said FIVE until 2026-09-05, and that was wrong from the
 * moment the slides line landed. `src/slides/SlidesInkSurface.ts` ships in the
 * plugin, but the presenter it draws on is `div.slides-container` appended to
 * `<body>` - not a workspace leaf, no workspace event, so every grep that
 * starts from a view misses it exactly the way the greps that start from the
 * plugin bundle missed the demo. It is the sixth, and it was caught by the
 * StrokeBuilder sweep below on the day the two lines were merged, which is the
 * only reason this sentence is being corrected on the same day rather than in
 * three releases' time.
 *
 * A document cannot hold this. The surfaces ground-truth section of
 * `1.4.9-design.md` carries the same table as prose, and prose that is not
 * executed rots exactly the way the two comments that hid the two most
 * expensive bugs of this cycle rotted. So the table lives HERE, in code, and
 * `InkSurfaceRules.test.ts` drives its assertions off this array. Cited by
 * title rather than section number on purpose: the numbering has collided
 * twice from parallel appends, and a number that has moved reads exactly like
 * one that has not.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THAT MORE THAN A LIST. This array is hand-written, and a
 * hand-written list looks executable because it compiles - compiling is not
 * checking. The header used to claim on its own authority that the array "makes
 * surface number five fail the suite on the day it is written", and it did not:
 * the demo HAD been surface five all along and the suite was green, because
 * nothing compared the array to the tree. The enforcement is now real and it
 * lives in `InkSurfaceRules.test.ts`, in the "derived from the tree, not
 * maintained by hand" block: every file constructing a StrokeBuilder must be a
 * named surface, every named surface must construct one, and `mountsStrip` is
 * derived from the MobileTools construction site rather than believed. That is
 * the same inversion `StripPenChrome.test.ts` made when it stopped reading a
 * hardcoded list of three files, and the same one `CornerSafeArea.test.ts` gets
 * from driving off `TOOLBAR_CORNERS`.
 *
 * WHY THE TWO CONSTRUCTIONS ABOVE ARE NAMED IN PROSE AND NOT SPELLED OUT -
 * AND WHY THAT IS NOW HABIT RATHER THAN NECESSITY. Writing either of them here
 * as the literal `new X(` used to put this file into the guards' own needles.
 * It was not hypothetical: spelling the MobileTools one turned this registry
 * into a strip-mounting surface and failed `StripPenChrome.test.ts`'s pairing
 * sweep, which demands that a file mounting a strip also consult
 * `penToolsVisible`. This file mounts nothing; it is a DOM-free description of
 * the tree.
 *
 * The reason it could happen was worth more than the workaround: that sweep
 * read RAW source, while `InkSurfaceRules.test.ts` blanked comments before
 * matching. Two guards built for one defect class, one of them protected. The
 * expensive direction was the inverse of the failure above and it was open:
 * a comment merely MENTIONING `penToolsVisible(` satisfied the pairing for a
 * file that never called it.
 *
 * CLOSED. Both guards now match against `codeOnly` (src/CodeOnly.ts) - one
 * function, imported by both, with fixtures in `InkSurfaceRules.test.ts`
 * pinning it against returning its input and fixtures in
 * `StripPenChrome.test.ts` pinning this file's own trigger against prose. The
 * prose-only spelling above is kept because it reads better, not because the
 * guard requires it.
 *
 * DOM-free by construction, like `TipMode.ts`, `PenToolsMode.ts` and
 * `ToolbarCorner.ts`: it is a description of the tree, imported by a test and
 * by nothing that runs in the plugin.

/**
 * The callbacks BOTH inline surfaces must wire. Named here rather than left
 * implicit in the interface because THIS is the duplication surface: note and
 * pdf each supply all of them, independently, and a rule implemented inside
 * two of these is a rule that can diverge. Kept in the declaration's own order.
 *
 * `InlinePenCallbacks` declares ELEVEN members: seven required, and four
 * optional. Membership here is not "is it required by the type" - it is "must
 * both surfaces answer it", and the two questions have come apart:
 *
 *   - `claimBandContact?` is optional and note-ONLY. Only the overlay has a
 *     linked-mentions band rendering outside the scroller to claim a contact
 *     on, so requiring it of both would report a legitimately surface-specific
 *     member as a divergence - the false positive that fills an allowlist with
 *     entries that mean nothing.
 *   - `describeChrome?` is optional and note-only for the same kind of reason:
 *     it is trace-only, and it answers for a strip the router holds no
 *     reference to. The pdf leaves it undefined.
 *   - `penOff?` is optional in the TYPE and required of both here, and it is
 *     the newest entry precisely because it spent two days being the other
 *     kind. It shipped note-only - the pdf passed nothing, so its router never
 *     gated on the pen-off state - and the owner reversed that ("why would you
 *     take keyboard mode away from pdf"): the state is whether this router
 *     claims the pen at all, which is a question every ink surface has the
 *     same answer to. It is here so the next surface that quietly stops
 *     wiring the gate fails this scan instead of shipping a switch that does
 *     nothing on one of two panes. Optional in the type because a router built
 *     by a harness has no opinion and undefined reads as "never off".
 *   - `onStrokeAbandoned?` is optional in the TYPE and required of both here.
 *     Optional because a router may be built by something with no chrome to
 *     stand down (the harnesses do); required of both because the thing it
 *     reports - a live stroke torn down with no lift, by a path that cannot
 *     commit what was drawn - happens identically on a note and on a pdf, and
 *     a surface that skipped it would be left wearing `is-inking` (opacity 0,
 *     visibility hidden) with no later switch able to repair it. That is
 *     exactly the one-surface divergence this array exists to make loud.
 *
 *     A WINDOW BLUR is no longer such a path, and this entry named it as the
 *     example until 2026-09-04. The owner's ruling that day ("alt tab mid
 *     stroke - sure make it consistent") made a blur COMMIT: the router's blur
 *     handler runs `finishActiveStroke()`, which reaches `onPenUp` exactly as
 *     a lift does. What still abandons is a surface tearing its own stroke
 *     down - the note switch (`InkOverlayPlugin.update`) and the pdf's
 *     in-place document change (`PdfInkController.forgetHistory`) - each of
 *     which calls `abandonActiveStroke()` itself and reads the boolean. The
 *     pdf routes that into its own `strokeAbandoned`; the note's branch runs
 *     the same teardown inline, so `InkOverlay.strokeAbandoned` is today
 *     reached through this member alone.
 *
 * This header said "seven REQUIRED" and "declares EIGHT". The first is now a
 * different claim, and the second was simply wrong before this edit:
 * `describeChrome?` had been added and the sentence never counted it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARRAY DOES NOT PROVE, said here so the row cannot be read as
 * coverage it is not. The check driven off it is a scan for `<name>:` in the
 * surface's own source: it proves the identifier is WIRED and says nothing
 * about what the body does, so replacing any of these bodies with an empty
 * arrow keeps it green. That is not a flaw in the row - presence across two
 * surfaces is exactly the divergence question it exists for - but for
 * `onStrokeAbandoned` it was, for two releases, the ONLY thing asserted, while
 * the body was the whole payload a user sees. The behaviour now lives where
 * behaviour belongs: `PdfInkController.test.ts`'s "the in-place document
 * switch stands down exactly the same things" drives `forgetHistory()` against
 * the real router the pdf builds, and `AbandonedGestureStandsDown.test.ts`
 * calls the note's body directly, because nothing in this repo can construct
 * an InkOverlayPlugin - its mount wants real canvases and a 2d context - so
 * the note's WIRING is still held by the scan alone. If that ever becomes
 * possible, that test is where the missing half goes.
 *
 * `onStrokeAbandoned` is, since the blur became a commit, UNREACHABLE from the
 * router itself: the one call site left (the blur handler's second branch)
 * can only run when no stroke was live, and `abandonActiveStroke()` returns
 * false in exactly that case. The row stays required all the same - the
 * callback's contract is "a stroke was really torn down", a future caller of
 * that branch could satisfy it, and the surfaces' `strokeAbandoned` bodies are
 * live code reached by their own abandon calls.
