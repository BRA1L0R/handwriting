/**
 * The e-ink hint's LIFECYCLE, executed rather than read.
 *
 * `EinkHint.test.ts` drives the decision and `LatencyEstimate.test.ts` drives
 * the evidence. Neither says anything about the parts a user actually feels:
 * that being told once survives a restart, that a failed write is not mistaken
 * for a durable one, that a rotten value in data.json cannot silence the hint
 * forever, and that the poll stops when the plugin does. d3b8bdb shipped with
 * none of that, and a green suite of 3,672 tests said nothing about it.
 *
 * HOW IT DRIVES THE REAL METHODS. `checkEinkHint`, `applyBooxMode`,
 * `saveSettingsNow`, `persistSettings` and `loadSettings` are the code under
 * test and NONE of them is stubbed. Following the pattern
 * `SettingsUnknownKeys.test.ts` established: `Object.create(
 * HandwritingPlugin.prototype)` for an instance with no field initialisers,
 * the few members those methods touch supplied by hand, and only the OBSIDIAN
 * boundary faked - `loadData`/`saveData` (the disk) and `Notice` (the screen).
 * The samples are real: every batch below goes through `recordPresentAge`, the
 * same call the render loop makes.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT PROVE, stated so nobody reads more into it. The `obsidian`
 * package ships no runtime, so `Plugin.registerInterval`'s real implementation
 * is not executed anywhere in this suite - the polling case below drives the
 * registration's ACTUAL source text against a host adapter that keeps
 * Obsidian's documented contract (a registered interval is cleared when the
 * component unloads). That is host-adapter coverage, not a live Obsidian run.
 * Nothing here touches a vault or a device.
