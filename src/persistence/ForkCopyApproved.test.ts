/**
 * THE GATE THAT WAS PROMISED IN A COMMENT AND DID NOT EXIST.
 *
 * `FORK_COPY_PLACEHOLDER`'s header used to say the marker existed "so an
 * unapproved string cannot reach a release build unnoticed". NOTHING ENFORCED
 * THAT. No test asserted the marker, the build config did not scan for it, and
 * `ForkResolution.test.ts` pins behaviour and never touches copy. The marker
 * was a convention read by people, not a gate - reported by the seat that
 * wrote the docstring, against its own work.
 *
 * The consequence was not hypothetical. Slot 6 was to keep its drafted wording
 * "as-is", and nothing would have stopped the literal text
 * "[COPY" + " TBD] cannot be read" shipping to a user on that reading. Alan
 * ruled it explicitly instead: wording kept, marker stripped like the rest.
 *
 * So this file is that gate, and it guards TWO different things:
 *
 *   1. THE TEN STRINGS ARE ALAN'S, EXACTLY. Pinned verbatim, the way
 *      `CommandPaletteNames.test.ts` pins his palette renames, and for the
 *      same reason: a command's copy is never read by its own callback, so
 *      NOTHING BEHAVIOURAL FAILS if wording drifts or a helpful builder
 *      "improves" it. A red here means someone changed approved copy, and the
 *      fix is to take it back to Alan, not to update this list.
 *
 *   2. NO SHIPPED SOURCE FILE CARRIES THE MARKER AT ALL. Not just this object -
 *      the whole tree, so the next placeholder anywhere is caught by the same
 *      rule rather than needing its own test.
 *
 * THE AUTHORITY FOR EVERY STRING BELOW is the recorded decision, not this
 * file: "2026-09-09
 * 10:04 CDT ... ALL TEN FORK-SCREEN STRINGS ARE APPROVED". He wrote them live
 * from a rendered presentation of the screen.
 *
 * WHY `codeOnly`: it blanks COMMENTS and deliberately leaves STRING LITERALS
 * alone, which is exactly the shape needed here - prose discussing the marker
 * (this docstring included) must not trip the sweep, while a marker inside a
 * shipped string must.
 *
 * WHY THE NEEDLE IS BUILT BY CONCATENATION: written whole it would appear in
 * this file's own source, and a sweep that matches itself is a sweep that can
 * never go green. Test files are excluded from the sweep as well, since they
 * do not ship - belt and braces, because either alone would be enough and
 * neither alone is obvious to the next reader.

 * other file is not the object the verbatim pins read.

 * that always had one. Authority is that 17:14 entry, which supersedes 17:09.
 *
 * THIS FILE MUST NOT CLAIM "EVERY APPROVED STRING ENDS IN A PERIOD". It is
 * false: the ink-trash restore line is ruled BARE, deliberately, because it
 * ends in a file path where a period reads as part of the path (17:21 CDT,
 * "leave that last one bare"). That string does not live in this object and is
 * pinned separately, by name, on the branch that owns it. The punctuated set
