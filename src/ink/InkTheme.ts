/**
 * Draw-time ink adaptation for the active Obsidian theme.
 *
 * The complaint this answers (alan, 2026-09-04): "the ink is black on black
 * obsidian". Ink imported from OneNote is stored as #000000, Obsidian's dark
 * theme paints the page near-black, and a whole imported page reads as blank.
 *
 * ONE rule, in ONE direction: near-black neutral ink is painted light on the
 * DARK theme, and nothing at all happens on the light theme. There used to be
 * a mirror rule - near-white ink painted #1E1E1E on the light theme - added
 * for symmetry rather than for a report, and symmetry was the wrong instinct.
 * The palette's "white" pen (#f4f4f2, InkColor.ts) is not ink that was
 * written on a light page and now needs rescuing; it is the pen you pick to
 * write ON something dark - a photo, a scanned figure, a highlighter wash -
 * and it stays white there whatever theme surrounds it. The mirror rule
 * turned every such annotation near-black, which is a defect the dark rule
 * exists to prevent, aimed at the other end of the palette (review,
 * 2026-09-04). No complaint ever motivated it, and it is gone.
 *
 * Nothing here ever touches a stroke. `InkStroke.color` stays exactly what was
 * written or imported; this module only decides what colour that stroke is
 * PAINTED with on this theme, on this frame. Switch the theme back, or turn
 * the setting off, and the same stored bytes paint their original colour
 * again. That is the whole promise, and it is the reason this is a renderer
 * concern and not a migration.
 *
 * ## Why luminance alone is not the test
 *
 * The rule wanted is "near-black ink goes light on a dark page", and the
 * obvious spelling of it - WCAG relative luminance below a threshold - is
 * wrong, because saturated dark HUES sit below the same threshold. A dark
 * navy (#004F8B) has relative luminance 0.075 and a deep green (#008C3A) has
 * 0.19; a luminance-only rule would repaint a page of blue annotations light
 * grey and throw away the colour the writer chose. (Navy is below the
 * threshold this module actually uses, so the neutrality test is what saves
 * it, not the threshold.)
 *
 * So a colour is a candidate only if it is NEUTRAL - its channels are within
 * NEUTRAL_SPREAD of each other, which is what "a grey" means numerically -
 * and only then is its luminance compared. #000, #111, #1F1F1F and OneNote's
 * slightly tinted blacks are neutral; every hue in the palette is not, and
 * passes through untouched.
 *
 * ## Hot path
 *
 * `inkColorFor` runs once per stroke per frame on a full committed repaint -
 * thousands of calls per frame on a long note - so after the first miss for a
 * given colour there is no allocation and no parse on this path: two Maps
 * (one per theme) keyed by the colour string itself, so the lookup key needs
 * no concatenation.

 * caught both, so a note written half in one and half in the other came out
 * on the dark theme as one flat #E6E6E6 and the distinction the writer chose

/**
 * ## Readable at the destination
 *
 * A second rule, aimed at a different complaint and pointing the other way.
 * Public, from the Reddit thread: ink drawn on the dark theme with the
 * palette's near-white pen (#f4f4f2) is exported onto a white PDF page and is
 * invisible. Alan was asked directly whether an export should reproduce the
 * screen or guarantee readable ink, and ruled: "guarantee readable ink".
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE MIRROR RULE the header above describes deleting, and it is
 * not the dark rule pointed at the light theme. `resolveInkColor(color,
 * false)` still returns its input before it parses, and nothing drawn on
 * screen changes. This is a CONTRAST guarantee against a destination whose
 * luminance is known: if a stroke would land on that destination below the
 * target ratio, its LIGHTNESS is moved until it passes, and nothing else
 * about it is touched.
 *
 * Why a contrast rule and not "near-white goes dark": the mirror fixes
 * #f4f4f2 and nothing else. Highlighter yellow #ffd60a sits at relative
 * luminance 0.69 - about 1.4:1 on white, which is not readable - and it is
 * not neutral, so the neutrality gate that protects hues on the dark side
 * waves it straight through. A rule that leaves the palette's lightest inks
 * invisible does not guarantee anything.
 *
 * THE PROMISE HERE IS WEAKER THAN THE DARK SIDE'S, AND IT IS WRITTEN DOWN
 * BECAUSE OF THAT. The dark rule protects hues by refusing anything
 * non-neutral outright, and its header records why: a luminance-only rule
 * would have repainted a page of blue annotations grey. A contrast rule MUST
 * touch hued ink - catching the yellow is the whole point - so it cannot hide
 * behind the same gate. What it promises instead: only LIGHTNESS moves. Hue
 * and saturation are carried through the adjustment unchanged, so ink that
 * has to darken is still the colour it was, and a page of blue annotations is
 * still blue. Anything that repaints a hue as a grey is a bug in this
 * function, not a trade-off it is allowed to make.
 *
 * A limit documented rather than solved: `InkStroke` stores only `color`
 * (Stroke.ts) - no provenance. Nothing here can tell "I chose white to write
 * on a dark scan" from "the pen was white because my theme is dark". Under a
 * READABILITY guarantee that stops being a blocker, because the promise holds
 * either way; the indifference is deliberate. Do not add a provenance field
 * to make this cleverer.
