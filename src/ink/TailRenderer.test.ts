 * thickening.

 * `drawHead` now takes an optional WORLD half-width and uses it when given.
 * This test reads that number directly, in world units, before any camera
 * conversion, by mocking `fillRibbon` - the one place `drawHead` hands its

/**
 * `clear()`'s no-box fallback, which is what lets the pen-up sites take the
 * dirty-rect clear at all.
 *
 * Three paths on this class PAINT and then null the dirty box without leaving
 * one behind - `drawLasso`, `drawSelectionBox` and `drawSpaceDivider`, and the
 * first says so in its own comment. Against a nulled box the old
 * `if (!this.dirty) return;` was a total NO-OP: measured in real Chromium over
 * three tail states x two zooms x two device pixel ratios, it left 920, 1453,
 * 3356 and 5091 painted pixels - in every case exactly what had been drawn,
 * nothing erased at all - where `clearAll` erased the canvas in all twelve
 * (`test/measure/TailClearBox.test.ts`, outside the gate).
 *
 * NOTE THE LIMIT OF THE CLAIM. That is a CONDITIONAL: if the box is null then
 * `clear()` erases nothing. Nobody has shown an ink pen-up can reach that
 * state - a pen-down dissolves the selection for a bare tip, and a lasso
 * gesture ends on its own branch - and this fallback is not evidence that it
 * can. It makes the question moot at no cost, which is why it is here instead
 * of a reachability hunt.
 *
 * This file has no real canvas, so the pixel count lives in the measure suite
 * above; what is pinned here is the CALL, executed - a nulled box plus a size
 * issues a whole-canvas clearRect - so the gate notices if the fallback goes.
