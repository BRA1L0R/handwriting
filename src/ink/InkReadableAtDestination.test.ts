/**
 * THE COMPLAINT, AS A SUITE.
 *
 * Public, from the Reddit thread: ink drawn on the dark theme with the
 * palette's near-white pen exports onto a white page and is invisible. Alan
 * ruled the direction - asked whether an export should reproduce the screen
 * or guarantee readable ink, "guarantee readable ink" - so what is pinned
 * here is the GUARANTEE, path by path, and the two things the guarantee is
 * not allowed to cost: the hue you chose, and the highlighter.
 *
 * Every path is asserted SEPARATELY and on purpose. This defect survived four
 * paint paths precisely because one painter was fixed and the rest were
 * assumed, and Flatten - which was about to be recommended publicly as the
 * workaround - had it too.
