/**
 * What the flatten writer may assume about the page it is writing onto.
 *
 * `inkToPdf` CREATES its page, so it knows that page is white and adapting the
 * ink to it is a guarantee. `appendInkToPdf` writes onto a page that already
 * exists and reads that page's dictionary, not its pixels - so white there is
 * a GUESS. It is the right guess for almost every document and the wrong one
 * for grey and dark stock, where adapting parks every adapted ink at one
 * luminance (~0.29, the smallest move that reaches the target) and a mid-grey
 * page sits exactly there.
 *
 * Alan ruled both halves on 2026-09-08: "ink readable on white pages" (so the
 * guess stays, by default) then "with a toggle in the setings" (so the people
 * it hurts can turn it off). Both branches are pinned here, along with the
 * proof that no third colour would have served both - which is why this is a
 * toggle and not a cleverer rule.
