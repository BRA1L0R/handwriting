/**
 * Ink to SVG (roadmap: export/print ink).
 *
 * Until now ink had no existence outside the plugin: copy the .md anywhere
 * and the page is silently blank. This gives the ink a portable form. The
 * geometry is EXACTLY the committed layer's: the same flatten (shaped for
 * pen, flat for highlighter, mirroring drawStroke's style choices), the same
 * ribbonSides offsets, the same caps and joint discs - so the export looks
 * like the note, and improvements to the renderer reach the exporter for
 * free. Coordinates are world units (note-space CSS px at zoom 1); the
 * viewBox is the ink's bounding box plus a margin, so the file opens at the
 * size of what was written, wherever it lands.
 *
 * Highlighter strokes ride in a group with the layer's opacity, matching
 * the single-pass translucency rule from styles.css (painting each stroke
 * translucent would double-blend every overlap into a dark seam).
 *
 * DESTINATION. An SVG this module writes has NO background of its own: it
 * emits fills and nothing else, so the file is transparent and what shows
 * through is whatever it is dropped onto. That is why a destination is a
 * PARAMETER here rather than the constant it is for the PDF and the snip -
 * this module genuinely cannot know it, and a caller that does (a print
 * sheet, a page of known colour) passes it so the ink is guaranteed readable
 * there. Omit it and the stored colours are emitted exactly as before, which
 * is what the live rendered layer wants.
 *
 * Pure string building over pure geometry: no DOM, loads under vitest.
