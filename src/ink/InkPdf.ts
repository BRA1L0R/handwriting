/**
 * Ink as a PDF.
 *
 * Two consumers, one writer. A note's page export needs a PDF CREATED, and a
 * flattened annotated PDF needs ink APPENDED to pages that already exist. The
 * drawing is identical in both; only the document surgery differs, so the
 * content stream is built separately from the file around it.
 *
 * Why a PDF at all, when the ink already exports as SVG: it is the format
 * people ask for, and a PDF page may be any size up to 200 inches. So this
 * emits ONE page sized to the content instead of paginating - which is what
 * sidesteps both failures of printing through the reading view, where a fixed
 * page width clips ink beside the text column and page breaks cut the surface
 * into pieces.
 *
 * Two coordinate facts, both easy to get wrong and both fixed here:
 *
 * - PDF's origin is BOTTOM-left with y increasing upward; ink lives in note
 *   space, top-left with y down. One `cm` at the head of the stream flips it,
 *   so every coordinate after that is written unchanged.
 * - PDF measures in points (1/72"), CSS in pixels (1/96"). The page box is
 *   converted; the ink is not, because the page carries that scale itself.
 *
 * Pure string building over pure geometry, like SvgExport. No DOM, no fs.
