/**
 * The ribbon cache: flattened committed geometry, remembered per stroke.
 *
 * The cause it removes: `drawStroke` re-flattened EVERY stroke on EVERY
 * repaint. A committed layer redraws in full on any camera change, so
 * scrolling a 3,000-stroke note ran 3,000 smoothing-plus-subdivision passes
 * per frame to produce, frame after frame, byte-identical geometry. The
 * flatten is the expensive half of the draw; `fillRibbon` is not.
 *
 * The trap the key is shaped around: committed strokes are MUTATED IN PLACE
 * (`translateStroke`, objects/Selection.ts - the lasso drag, the
 * insert-space drag and the undo/redo of both). Object identity alone would
 * therefore hand back geometry computed at the OLD position and the ink would
 * render where it was, which is why the entry carries a revision from
 * StrokeRev and a hit demands it match. Zoom is compared EXACTLY - the number
 * the flatten actually received - because it feeds the subdivision count, and
 * a rounded compare would serve coarse geometry at a finer zoom. Shaping is
 * the effective decision (InkShape's global toggle, the highlighter's flat
 * wash and the mouse law folded together), since flipping it changes the
 * half-width law. `smooth` is the CENTERLINE decision and is carried
 * separately because the two can disagree: a mouse stroke is never shaped, so
 * its `shaping` is false in both settings while its centerline still follows
 * the toggle - keyed on `shaping` alone, toggling the setting would have
 * served that stroke its stale ribbon forever.
 *
 * `pressure` is `pressureSensitivityEnabled()`, which `widthForPressure`
 * substitutes at EVERY sample and which neither `shaping` nor `smooth`
 * implies: it is its own setting with its own command, and both writers
 * (`applyPressureSensitivity` and the settings tab) repaint by calling
 * `repaintAllInkOverlays`, which found rev, zoom, shaping and smooth all
 * unchanged and handed back the ribbon built under the OTHER width law. A
 * page could show two, whichever strokes happened to be cached. `tool` is
 * here for completeness of the derivation - it decides `flat`, which decides
 * both `shaping` and `smooth` - and costs a comparison; no in-place tool
 * mutation exists today, so it is a guard and not a fix.
 *
 * Memory: a WeakMap holds nothing alive, so the cache is bounded by the
 * strokes the stores already hold. Ribbons for strokes scrolled far out of
 * view do stay resident until the stroke itself is collected - accepted: a
 * ribbon is a flat array of {x, y, hw}, and evicting by viewport would mean
 * re-flattening exactly the strokes a scroll is about to bring back.
 *
 * Pinch zoom misses on every frame by construction (the zoom changes), which
 * costs what today costs and no more.

 * has nothing to reuse and no business holding an entry. Only src/site's demo
 * passes a wet stroke here at all - every real surface draws its wet layer

 * `styleOverride` also bypasses the cache: the override changes the width law
 * the ribbon is flattened under, and it is not part of the key (PenLabView is
 * the only caller that passes one).
 *
 * `ribbon` was called `smooth` until 1.4.6 and never meant smoothing. It
 * selects the RENDERING: the one-fill ribbon outline (true) or the legacy
 * chain of separately stroked capsules (false, and why Ribbon.ts exists).
 * Every surface passes true; only PenLabView's Raw/Smoothed mode buttons pass
 * false, and they pass it to WetInkRenderer.smooth for the same axis. The
 * name is the whole reason this slice had to look twice: "Ink smoothing" in
 * settings, `smooth` here and `smoothSegments` in Smoothing.ts named three
 * different things, and the one the setting claimed to control - the
 * centerline - was the one with no switch at all. The centerline decision is
 * now read from `centerlineSmoothed` and nowhere else, so a caller cannot
 * override the user's setting with a literal.
