/**
 * The purged-canvas sentinel: an invisible pixel that says whether WebKit
 * still has our pixels.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. 1.4.12-design.md §14 ranks the iPad "ink disappears while
 * scrolling" report first as this: WebKit reclaims a canvas's backing store
 * under memory pressure and fires no event, and the scroll repaint draws
 * NOTHING while the camera is still (`scheduleRepaint("scroll")` adds no
 * damage; a band scroll is not camera motion by design). So purged ink stays
 * gone until the band moves or the note is reopened - which is precisely the
 * "open another note and come back" workaround the reporter found. The
 * foreground repaint (ForegroundRepaint.ts) covers a purge that happened
 * while the app was away. This covers one that happens while the user never
 * leaves: paint a marker the eye cannot see, and on a scroll repaint that had
 * no work, read it back. Gone means the canvas was reclaimed.
 *
 * IT IS OFF UNLESS DIAGNOSTICS ARE RECORDING, and that is a decision, not an
 * oversight. `getImageData` is a synchronous readback: WebKit's GPU-process
 * architecture makes it a blocking IPC round trip, and this repo has already
 * been here once - `WetInkRenderer.countPainted` is documented "never on the
 * hot path", and the one `getImageData` in this codebase (diag/Raster.ts) is
 * a diagnostics call reached once per pen-up. What nobody could establish
 * from a primary source is whether the pixel TRANSFER is scoped to the
 * requested 1x1 rect or to the whole multi-megapixel surface. That unknown is
 * the difference between microseconds and milliseconds at 3 Hz, during a
 * scroll, on a device none of us owns. So the logic ships complete and under
 * test, and the readback runs only while `diagnosticsEnabled()` - the
 * SESSION switch, not the persisted `devDiagnostics` setting, so an ordinary
 * session pays one boolean and nothing else. One `performance.now()`
 * measurement of the real call on the reporter's iPad, under the exact
 * "scroll repaint found no work" condition, is what would turn it on for
 * everyone.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSUMED AND NOT PROVEN: that a canvas WebKit has reclaimed reads
 * back as transparent rather than being restored under the reader. If WebKit
 * replays or restores the surface before serving `getImageData`, the sentinel
 * reads healthy on a canvas that is visibly blank and the heal never fires.
 * That failure is silent and costs nothing but the readback, which is the
 * right way round for a guess: it cannot make the bug worse.

 * CSS px, so canvas row 0 sits above anything the scroller can show. Even at
 * full opacity nobody would see this; at 1/255 it is not a question.
 *
 * Cleared before it is filled so calling it twice is the same as calling it
 * once. That matters: a partial repaint whose damage covers the corner wipes
 * the marker, so the caller repaints it after every armed paint, and without
 * the clear the alpha would climb one step per paint until it was visible.
