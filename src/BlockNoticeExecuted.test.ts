/**
 * EXECUTE `blockNotice`'s fragment branch, rather than reading it.
 *
 * I named this as a liability myself: the branch that builds a DocumentFragment
 * had never been run. I established that Obsidian appends a fragment rather
 * than stringifying it by reading `Element.prototype.setText` out of
 * obsidian.asar, and reading is not running. `NoticeBlocks.test.ts` covers the
 * pure splitter; this covers the part that touches the DOM helpers.
 *
 * `blockNotice` is NOT exported - which is how it stayed unexecuted, and is a
 * reason to slice it rather than to widen main.ts's export surface for a test.
 * Same idiom as `LiveReloadTestHarness.ts`: take the real source, transpile it,
 * run it, and assert the extraction boundary so a moved function fails LOUDLY
 * instead of quietly testing nothing.
