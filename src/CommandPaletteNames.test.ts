/**
 * The command-palette renames from Alan's "toggles say toggle" ruling -
 * "every toggle should say toggle on/off becuase a toggle is not clear at
 * first" and "why is it named copy selected ink, does it not work on text?"
 * (it is ink only; text is Obsidian's own copy/paste, hence "Lasso: ...") -
 * plus the three commands that ruling moved out of the palette entirely
 * ("pen/highlighter: switch... pen pressure: recalibrate... pressure
 * sensitivity... those are all settings").
 *
 * Pinned as SOURCE TEXT rather than behaviour, deliberately: a command's
 * `name:` is never read by its own callback, so nothing behavioural fails
 * if a rename drifts back, or a removed command's block returns through a
 * bad merge - and this branch is exactly the shape that could happen in,
 * since a sibling slice touches these same callback BODIES while this one
 * renames the `name:` fields beside them. `id:` is the hotkey and doc
 * contract and stays unchanged everywhere a command survives; each pairing
 * below asserts the id alongside its new name so a future change to either
 * has to happen here too.
 *
 * Source text via `import.meta.glob` + `?raw`, the house pattern
 * (StripPenChrome.test.ts, InkSurfaceRules.test.ts): this repo has no
 * `@types/node`, so `fs.readFileSync` fails `tsc -noEmit`. Comments are
 * stripped first through the shared `codeOnly`, so a stale comment
 * mentioning an old name cannot satisfy an assertion below, and a removed
 * id surviving only in prose cannot fail one either - both directions read
 * CODE only.
